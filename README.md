# 💬 Sentiment Analysis from Text using Deep Learning

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** to classify text data as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using advanced **Deep Learning** models such as **LSTM** and **BERT**.  
Developed as part of B.Tech Final Year Project under the guidance of **Mrs. Jayanthi Harini**, Assistant Professor, Adikavi Nannaya University, Rajahmundry.

## 🧠 Abstract
Sentiment Analysis, also known as Opinion Mining, identifies emotions or opinions expressed in textual data.  
This project implements **Deep Learning models (LSTM, BERT)** for text classification and compares them with traditional Machine Learning algorithms like **Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression**.

The LSTM model achieved **92.3% accuracy**, outperforming traditional ML models that ranged between 58–62% accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To automate text sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- To overcome the limitations of traditional ML models.
- To implement a hybrid approach using **LSTM** and **BERT embeddings**.
- To deploy the model using a **Flask Web Application**.
